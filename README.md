### Data Usage Notice
This app stores the code entered by the user locally on the device to process the user’s code and compare it with the solution. CodeJudge performs all evaluation locally on your device.
No code is uploaded or transmitted to any server. All stored data is anonymous and used solely for functionality within the app.

### Security Notice
This app generates a file containing the Code entered by the user. This file is necessary for the whole backend and it's overwritten as soon as the user enters Code using the same programming language.
While no personal data is collected or transmitted, users should be aware that unencrypted data may be accessible to other apps on the same device.
To mitigate this risk, we recommend using devices with secure storage and keeping your system up to date. All data remains local and anonymous.

### Disclaimer
This app was developed to help computer science students preparing for their exams written on paper or at least without helpers like syntax highlighting. This means that CodeJudge intentionally provides no helpers such as syntax highlighting or auto‑completion. Since this app depends on good exercises feel free to add or improve exercises!
